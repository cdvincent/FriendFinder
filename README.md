# FriendFinder
<h3>Welcome to FriendFinder!</h3>

<p>Friend FInder is an application that allows you to find a new friend based on answering the same questions. Click start on the homepage to be directed to the survey. You will have to enter your name and supply an image link into the form, then proceed to answering all of the questions.</p>

<p>Be sure to answer all questions truthfully to get the best result. There is form validation, so if you fail to fill in a portion of the survey, you will be prompted to fill in that part of the survey before proceeding. Once you submit you responses, the application will search through all previously entered friends to find your best match. The results add up the total score from your answers and will return the closest score whether their score is higher or lower than yours.</p>

<p>This app uses bootstrap for the layout and styling, as well as for the modal which shows your friend match. It also uses a combination of express and path in order to communicate with the back end and post/get results to and from the friends API. Your survey response will be added to the rest for future users to find!</p>
